Battleship - 
When I originally did the bonus for Battleship I created a seperate bonus folder with my solution. I choose to do this because I was including two players in the game which would break the spec files.
I saw in Slack that another way to make this a two player game without breaking the specs would be to run two games simultaneously. This makes a lot of sense and I plan to try it out. But I wanted to get this prepwork in asap because I am targeting the March cohort.

Blogger -
I completed all of the suggested Extras for the blogger project except for the final RSS one. I struggled a bit with these extras and am planning to work throught the Hartl book to get a better understanding of Rails. 
I also messed with the CSS a bit to make the sidebar be an actual sidebar. However, I don't really know CSS, so it isn't the most beautiful creation. It does have that sidebar though! :)

Project Euler and Codeeval bonus problems -
I have included some of these bonus problems in this directory as well. Time prevented me from doing as many as I would have liked, but I will continue to work on them.
